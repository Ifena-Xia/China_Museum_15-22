  <h2>Background Information</h2>
  
  <p>China has been actively protecting and promoting its intangible cultural heritage since 2005. Several scholars suggest that this intangible heritage “boom” is triggered by the successful registration of the Dano festival onto the UNESCO intangible heritage list by South Korea in the same year (Wu, 2020; Ke, 2022). China’s heritage projects are believed to enhance its cultural soft power in the global arena while contributing to domestic nation-building efforts (Sen, 2010). Besides the efforts in UNESCO heritage list registration, China also spares no efforts to build museums. 2007 witnessed a conspicuous growth in the count, size, and expenditure of museums, accompanied by significant increase in subsidies. This museum boom was observed and reported as early as 2018 (Zhang, 2021). As a crucial platform for the manifestation of cultural objects and public education (Blunden, 2016), museums constitute part of politics of identity. Despite museums’ status identified by Chinese legislation as “a basis for patriotic education” through the commemoration and celebration of Chinese history (Bollo & Zhang, 2017), museum boom receives much less attention than heritage boom.</p>

  <p>Since museum building and maintaining would enormously consume time, money, and human resources, it is unsurprising that wealthier provinces will witness more rapid growth in the number of museums and larger amount of subsidies. However, Fenghua Zhang and Pascal Courty’s research shows that despite economic disparities, museum growth in the time span between 1996 and 2015 was relatively balanced across regions, suggesting deliberate government efforts to improve accessibility and cultural equity (Zhang & Courty, 2021). The goal of this study is to verify whether this conclusion is still valid after 2016.</p>
  
  <p>Access to museums in China is mainly shaped by political and economic factors. The museum construction in China was closely related to political situations from the very first beginning (Sih, 1970). After the founding of People’s Republic of China (PRC), the development of museums has been part of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)’s governing policy from 1949 to the present in order to serve the economic, ideological and political needs of the Party and the state. Perusing historical documentaries, concludes that interpreting the value of “cultural heritage” with the revolutionary view, claiming the national ownership of “cultural heritage,” and establishing the leadership of CCP in all the public museums are core part of cultural regulations of CCP (Lu, 2014). Although the absolute regulation of CCP has become unnecessary after the reform in 1980s, the development of museums is still considered as part of CCP’s governing policy in cultural industry. In addition, the economic growth since 1980s has also encouraged the government officials to show their performance by establishing more museums (Shan, 2009).</p>

  <p>Through examining the National Museum of China in Beijing and the Liaoning Provincial Museum in Shenyang, Gideon Shelach-Lavi argues that in modern Chinese public museums, there is an inclusive view of Chinese history and culture, and that the narratives of the past in the archaeological exhibitions embodies a continuous process shaping a unified Chinese culture (Shelach-Lavi, 2019). His opinion that the way the past is presented in Chinese museums actually reveals a process of entrenching the standardized narrative of Chinese history and establishing a powerful sense of connection and continuity between the past and the present resonates with several studies in Chinese nationalism. With the upsurge of cultural nationalism and suspicion toward CCP since 1990s, state intervention in cultural projects has been strengthened (Walton, 2012; Zhao, 2004) . By virtue of the Program for China’s Education Reform and Development, patriotic themes were introduced as the replacement of Marxism and interpreted as a long-lasting tradition in Chinese culture. Efforts were made to link PRC’s founding with China’s Confucian past to justify CCP’s power of interpretation on Chinese tradition and culture (Lin, 2023). This phenomenon was also observed by Western reporters (Mufson, 1996).</p>

  <h2>Data and Method</h2>
  
  <p>Data employed in this paper comes from the Statistical Yearbook of Cultural Relics of China (SYCRC) and statistical reports published by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism (MCT). From the Yearbook we can see the numbers of museums in every province while in the reports we can see other information including tourist reception, expenditure, subsidy, etc. These variables are especially concentrated on: GDP per capita, total museum subsidy, and total museum expenditure in Eastern, Central, and Western regions.</p>
  
  <p>Subsidy refers to direct financial support from the government to museums which ensures operational sustainability and are tied to government policy changes. Financial provision allocated by the central government plays a vital role in museum visit in China. Zhang and Courty demonstrate that the increasing museum attendance in China is largely explained by policies that stimulated the development of museum infrastructure and reduced the admission fees rather than the rising income of residents, which means, the upsurging museum visit is driven more by government investment than public’s cultural demand (Zhang & Courty, 2022). Expenditure represents the total operational spending of museums, excluding infrastructure costs. It includes costs like staff salaries, exhibitions, educational activities, and professional training. According to Frey and Meier, expenditure can be used as a proxy for museum quality and reflects the overall investment in enhancing museum services (Frey & Meier, 2006).</p>
  
  <p>Zhang and Courty used per capita museum subsidy and expenditure against per capita GDP in their study. However, given the great disparity in population distribution (the latest demographic census in 2020 shows eastern provinces’ population accounts for almost 40%, rising 2.5% compared to 2010’s census), the actual subsidies received by museums in eastern provinces should be far beyond those received by middle and western provinces, disproportional to the numbers and sizes of museums. A large museum in a densely populated area may receive more absolute funding than multiple smaller museums in sparsely populated areas, even if per capita figures suggest “equal” investment. For instance, here I list the statistics of Inner Mongolia (western province) and Guangdong (eastern province) in 2020. We can seen although the subsidy per capita of Inner Mongolia exceeds that of Guangdong, the subsidy per square meter of Guangdong is twice that of Inner Mongolia.</p>
  
  <h3>Guangdong vs. Inner Mongolia: A Case Comparison</h3>
  <img src="Comparison between Guangdong and Inner Mongolia.png" alt="Guangdong vs. Inner Mongolia" />

  <p>I think expenditure and subsidy per square meter of museums will be better in showing intensity of government investment. This metric shows how much funding is allocated per unit of museum space, offering a more precise measure of government commitment to museum infrastructure. Unlike per capita figures, per square meter subsidy controls for differences in museum size and distribution, giving a clearer picture of funding fairness. </p>

  <h2>Regional Patterns</h2>
  
  <p>In reports made by MCT, Eastern region includes Beijing, Tianjin, Liaoning Province, Shanghai, Jiangsu Province, Zhejiang Province, Fujian Province, Shandong Province, and Guangdong Province; Central region includes Hebei Province, Shanxi Province, Jilin Province, Heilongjiang Province, Anhui Province, Jiangxi Province, Henan Province, Hubei Province, Hunan Province and Hainan Province; Western region includes Inner Mongolia (autonomous region), Guangxi Province, Chongqing, Sichuan Province, Guizhou Province, Yunan Province, Tibet (autonomous region), Shannxi Province, Gansu Province, Qinghai Province, Ningxia (autonomous region), and Xinjiang (autonomous region). </p>

  <h2>Key Finding</h2>
  
  <p>Despite intuitive expectations and heatmap results, these variables show no strong or statistically significant correlation via both Pearson Correlation and Spearman’s Rank Correlation. It might due to the relationship between museum sizes and GDP per capita. Our model verifies this strong correlation.</p>

  <p>These findings suggest that while investment in cultural infrastructure is widespread, it may not be directly linked to local economic development, raising new questions about policy priorities and evaluation metrics.</p>
